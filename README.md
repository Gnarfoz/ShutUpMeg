Shut up, Meg!
=========
Or whatever your name is.

This Wildstar addon automatically stops the playback of the datacube audio that starts when you discover a new datacube.

Caveat: I can't get rid of the jingle that plays the instant you click the datacube. It is not played through the addon system, apparently. Also, the function to stop the playback has a fade-out built in, so you might hear the first word or two of the narration before it fades out.

Has no configuration and should affect all new datatcubes. Has no effect on the lore window, allowing you to listen to the datacubes later.
